title: 'Three Musical Concepts that Apply to Coding'

When I reflect on my time as a musician, I found that there were always three things I heard from every single teacher I studied with. Coincidentally, I think these lessons also apply to good habits to adapt in growing yourself as a developer/lifelong learner!

### Focus On Tangible Goals

When I first started taking music seriously, I was all over the place with my practice routine. I would pick up my instrument without thinking at ALL about what I wanted to accomplish that day. This led to a lot of wasted time and effort without a ton of improvement. Once I entered college, my trumpet professor encouraged me to start writing down what I wanted to accomplish prior to my practice sessions. This really helped me make sure I entered my practice sessions with very clear goals to achieve. I found that I was not only accomplishing my goals, but improving at a much faster rate. I started taking this approach with everything in my life and noticed similar growth!

Often as developers, it can be overwhelming to even conceptualize the sheer amount of specializations and technologies that we can learn. Typical job postings make you feel as though you alone have to be an entire development team which just perpetuates this problem. I firmly believe that you should get really good at ONE THING before moving onto the next. For example, say your ultimate goal is to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. Start with Front End development and really work on understanding the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After you've done that, maybe consider adding in a JavaScript framework/library (I will explain how to select your framework in another post). Only after you've had enough experience to adequately understand fundamentals of Front End development, then you can move onto learning Back End development. You get the idea? It's almost cliche to say but becoming a better developer is definitely a marathon, not a sprint!

### Apply What You Learn to Practical Applications

In order to improvise coherently over a Jazz Standard, a musician must know how to play their scales, chords and have a fundamental understanding of harmony. Similar to programming, in order to write a complex application, you MUST know your fundamentals. I still spend time EVERY day reviewing fundamentals both on my instrument and my coding. In my opinion, the best way to really practice your fundamentals is to apply your skills practically.

The most common issues I hear from new developers are related to being in "tutorial hell." They are unable to code a coherent application without the help of a tutorial holding their hand. I am not saying to never use tutorials, look things up or look at examples of good code. That is how you SHOULD learn! I do believe tutorials/classes serve a purpose, however, you MUST consciously break away at a certain point and just try to build something on your own! Try starting a project and just using the relevant documentation to help complete it. By the time you are done, you will have done two things: 1) You will have built a project to add to your portfolio (this is SUPER key to landing your first role) 2) You will have gained a more practical understanding of the technology you are trying to learn. You will be surprised how much your ability to quickly learn new skills will grow!

The details of my process for internalizing new skills/technologies will be discussed in a later blog post!

### Be Honest But Not Too Hard on Yourself

One huge thing I took away from my time with Jon Faddis was to be honest with yourself. As people, we try to do things we are comfortable with and make us feel good, it's only natural! However, we are just massaging our egos and taking away opportunities for us to really address our short comings. I used to do this ALL the time and it led to me plateauing! I would go into the practice room, work on tunes I knew I could play because I had worked on similar ones and I would sound great. However, when I would get called to play tunes on a gig that I didn't know, I would avoid improvising over them. I eventually came to terms with my shortcomings and began spending time every day practicing things I sucked at. I once again noticed that my trumpet playing slowly but surely started to get better.

This is definitely more of a something to do with your approach to your life than necessarily just technology, but I have found that applying this concept has been very helpful. I find that I spend a lot of time getting out of my comfort zone and learning a lot more than I used to. I will also offer a caveat to this; it is possible to be TOO critical of yourself. Try not to do this and if you find your friends/family pointing out that you are being too hard on yourself, dial it down. You will eventually learn how to balance this new mindset so it is productive to your every day life!

I will be taking a couple weeks off from blogging to enjoy time with my family during this Thanksgiving season. I hope you all have a very Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy your time with your loved ones!!!
