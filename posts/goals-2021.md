I'm back! I apologize for the long hiatus from blogging, I needed to take some time to recharge and deal with some personal things going on. I feel much better now and very focused going into the New Year.

I typically start my year with writing all the categories of my life and identifying areas of improvement or desired outcomes for each. This tradition started roughly 3 years ago when I was VERY unhappy with my job at the time. I spent a lot of time outside of work listening to what successful people do to become successful and help with their mindset. An overwhelming practice I found was that these people took time constantly to project what they wanted to accomplish and put it in writing. I have found that by doing this, it essentially commits you to try and complete these goals and also keeps you incredibly focused. After doing this,when I looked at my goals at the end of each year, they are usually pretty close to being fully accomplished. I would highly recommend giving this a try!

In the spirit of transparency and wanting to share with you all what I am working on, here are my current goals and categories for the year :

1. Personal Health - Continue to work out, eat healthy and lose weight at a healthy rate

2. Career - Transition to a role where I can focus more on Front End Web Development

3. Hobby - Continue to work on learning Tunes and Transcriptions on the Trumpet

4. Friends - Make time to catch up with a friend every week

5. Relationship - Make time every week to do something fun with Katherine

6. Family - Continue to make time to hang out with my parents and help them get settled in GA (COVID permitting)

7. Personality - Continue to work on being patient and giving grace to people, even when I don't fully understand what's going on

8. Financial - Continue to work on saving for the many amazing things I'd like to do that will require money in the next few years

9. Coding - Continue growing my programming skills and learning technologies that will help me grow into an Enterprise Architecture role in the future

10. Dog - Take Gigi on a walk on the trail near my house every day!

These goals are NOT all related to programming and I couldn't be more thrilled with that. A big reason a lot of people burnout while trying to transition from Junior to Senior developers is actually due to focusing too much on just work. I am trying to be much more mindful on spending time enjoying my life but still adding in a good amount of things to learn and work on that could relate to my career.

When I look back at 2020, it was obviously a year full of a lot of unexpected change. However, despite that rapid level of change, I still managed to grow a lot personally and couldn't be more thrilled for that. I am incredibly to grateful to be where I am right now and can't wait to see what this year brings for me, my friends and family.

I hope you all have a great start to 2021 and please feel free to reach out if you need anything!

Signing off,

Sean
