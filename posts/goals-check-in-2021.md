Now that the end of 2021 is near, I thought it would be fun for me to list out my goals for the year and see if I achieved what I set out to do!

### Continue to work out, eat healthy and lose weight at a healthy rate

This was a goal that I was unable to achieve. Due to a lot of unexpected challenges at work and my newly engaged status, I did not have the needed time to prioritize this. I will carry this goal over for 2022 and plan to have a more structured plan for this.

### Transition to a role where I can focus more on Front End Web Development

Proud to say that I accomplished this! I have been serving as a React developer on our Personal Web Ordering project and have been loving it. I have grown my skills significantly and have a good feeling my 2022 will be fruitful due to a lot of the work I put in this year!

### Continue to work on learning Tunes and Transcriptions on the Trumpet

I have stayed relatively true to this goal! I have been learning standards as often as I can and learn a transcript every month. I plan to continue to do this but probably won't make this a goal for next year.

### Make time to catch up with a friend every week

Proud to say that I have made this happen! I really have enjoyed the opportunity to stay connected to so many dear friends of mine during the pandemic prior to my wedding.

### Make time every week to do something fun with Katherine

Definitely have done this! Being newly engaged, we have made plenty of time to hang out with one another and continue to strengthen our relationship.

### Continue to make time to hang out with my parents and help them get settled in GA (COVID permitting)

Yes and yes! I helped my parents buy this house in GA and have been trying to encourage them to expand their social life.

### Continue to work on being patient and giving grace to people, even when I don't fully understand what's going on

I think I have gotten significantly better at this but plan to have a goal related to this again next year. This is an area I am weak in and need to constantly remind myself of this.

### Continue to work on saving for the many amazing things I'd like to do that will require money in the next few years

Yup yup! Not too much to say here, have been saving just fine and have been investing into retirement in my 401k and Roth IRA.

### Continue growing my programming skills and learning technologies that will help me grow into an Enterprise Architecture role in the future

Done this in spades! I definitely have exceeded even my own dreams in terms of how I have grown this year. However, I am not totally certain I want to be an Enterprise Architect anymore. I have realized during this past while that I want to be more focused on products than platforms as a whole. I likely want to go the route of being a Lead Engineer and moved into some sort of Engineering Leadership role on my team.

### Take Gigi on a walk on the trail near my house every day!

Done! Super easy goal and we have prioritized this every day, even during bad weather.

### Reflection

I am very proud of myself for all I have achieved this year! Considering I basically did 9/10 goals, that's pretty solid. I am really looking forward to spending these next couple weeks reflecting and getting ready to set my goals for next year.

Signing off,

Sean
