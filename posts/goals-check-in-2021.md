Now that the end of 2021 is near, I thought it would be fun for me to list out my goals for the year and see if I achieved what I set out to do!

### Continue to work out, eat healthy and lose weight at a healthy rate

This was a goal that I was unable to achieve. Due to a lot of unexpected challenges at work and my newly engaged status, I did not have the needed time to prioritize this. I will carry this goal over for 2022 and plan to have a more structured plan for this.

### Transition to a role where I can focus more on Front End Web Development

Proud to say that I accomplished this! I have been serving as a React developer on our Personal Web Ordering project and have been loving it. I have grown my skills significantly and have a good feeling my 2022 will be fruitful due to a lot of the work I put in this year!

### Continue to work on learning Tunes and Transcriptions on the Trumpet

I have stayed relatively true to this goal! I have been learning standards as often as I can and learn a transcript every month. I plan to continue to do this but probably won't make this a goal for next year.

### Make time to catch up with a friend every week

Proud to say that I have made this happen! I really have enjoyed the opportunity to stay connected to so many dear friends of mine during the pandemic prior to my wedding.

### Make time every week to do something fun with Katherine

### Continue to make time to hang out with my parents and help them get settled in GA (COVID permitting)

### Continue to work on being patient and giving grace to people, even when I don't fully understand what's going on

### Continue to work on saving for the many amazing things I'd like to do that will require money in the next few years

### Continue growing my programming skills and learning technologies that will help me grow into an Enterprise Architecture role in the future

### Take Gigi on a walk on the trail near my house every day!

### Reflection

Signing off,

Sean
